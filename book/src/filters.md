# Filters

Values such as those obtained from variables can be post-processed
using **filters**.
Filters are applied to values using the pipe symbol (`|`) and may
have optional extra arguments in parentheses.
Filters can be chained, in which case the output from one filter
is passed to the next.

```
{{ "HELLO" | lower }}
```

Askama has a collection of built-in filters, documented below, but can also include custom filters. 
Additionally, the `json` filter is included in the built-in filters, but is disabled by default.
Enable it with Cargo features (see below for more information).

## Built-In Filters
[#built-in-filters]: #built-in-filters

### capitalize
[#capitalize]: #capitalize

Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase:

```jinja
{{ "hello" | capitalize }}
```

Output:

```text
Hello
```

### center
[#center]: #center

Centers the value in a field of a given width:

```jinja
-{{ "a" | center(5) }}-
```

Output:
```text
-  a  -
```

### deref
[#deref]: #deref

Dereferences the given argument.

```jinja
{% let s = String::from("a") | as_ref %}
{% if s | deref == String::from("b") %}
{% endif %}
```

will become:

```rust
let s = &String::from("a");
if *s == String::from("b") {}
```

### escape | e
[#escape]: #escape--e

Escapes HTML characters in strings:

```jinja
{{ "Escape <>&" | e }}
```

Output:

```html
Escape &lt;&gt;&amp;
```

Optionally, it is possible to specify and override which escaper is used. 
Consider a template where the escaper is configured as [`escape = "none"`]. 
However, somewhere escaping using the HTML escaper is desired. 
Then it is possible to override and use the HTML escaper like this:

```jinja
{{ "Don't Escape <>&" | escape }}
{{ "Don't Escape <>&" | e }}

{{ "Escape <>&" | escape("html") }}
{{ "Escape <>&" | e("html") }}
```

Output:

```text
Don't Escape <>&
Don't Escape <>&

Escape &lt;&gt;&amp;
Escape &lt;&gt;&amp;
```

[`escape = "none"`]: creating_templates.html#the-template-attribute

### filesizeformat
[#filesizeformat]: #filesizeformat

Returns adequate string representation (in KB, ..) of number of bytes:

```jinja
{{ 1000 | filesizeformat }}
```

Output:
```text
1 KB
```

### fmt

[#fmt]: #fmt

Formats arguments according to the specified format

The *second* argument to this filter must be a string literal (as in normal
Rust). The two arguments are passed through to [`format!()`] by
the Askama code generator, but the order is swapped to support filter
composition.

```jinja
{{ value | fmt("{:?}") }}
```

As an example, this allows filters to be composed like the following.
Which is not possible using the `format` filter.

```jinja
{{ value | capitalize | fmt("{:?}") }}
```

### format
[#format]: #format

Formats arguments according to the specified format.

The first argument to this filter must be a string literal (as in normal Rust).

All arguments are passed through to [`format!()`] by the Askama code generator.

```jinja
{{ "{:?}" | format(var) }}
```

[`format!()`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.format.html

### indent
[#indent]: #indent

Indent newlines with width spaces.

```jinja
{{ "hello\nfoo\nbar" | indent(4) }}
```

Output:

```text
hello
    foo
    bar
```

### join
[#join]: #join

Joins iterable into a string separated by provided argument.

```rust
array = &["foo", "bar", "bazz"]
```

```jinja
{{ array | join(", ") }}
```

Output:

```text
foo, bar, bazz
```

### linebreaks
[#linebreaks]: #linebreaks

Replaces line breaks in plain text with appropriate HTML.

A single newline becomes an HTML line break `<br>` and a new line followed by a blank line becomes a paragraph break `<p>`.

```jinja
{{ "hello\nworld\n\nfrom\naskama" | linebreaks }}
```

Output:

```html
<p>hello<br />world</p><p>from<br />askama</p>
```

### linebreaksbr
[#linebreaksbr]: #linebreaksbr

Converts all newlines in a piece of plain text to HTML line breaks.

```jinja
{{ "hello\nworld\n\nfrom\naskama" | linebreaks }}
```

Output:

```html
hello<br />world<br /><br />from<br />askama
```

### paragraphbreaks
[#paragraphbreaks]: #paragraphbreaks

A new line followed by a blank line becomes `<p>`, but, unlike `linebreaks`, single new lines are ignored and no `<br/>` tags are generated.

Consecutive double line breaks will be reduced down to a single paragraph break.

This is useful in contexts where changing single line breaks to line break tags would interfere with other HTML elements, such as lists and nested `<div>` tags.

```jinja
{{ "hello\nworld\n\nfrom\n\n\n\naskama" | paragraphbreaks }}
```

Output:

```html
<p>hello\nworld</p><p>from</p><p>askama</p>
```

### lower | lowercase
[#lower]: #lower--lowercase

Converts to lowercase.

```jinja
{{ "HELLO" | lower }}
```

Output:

```text
hello
```

### `pluralize`
[#pluralize]: #pluralize

Select a singular or plural version of a word, depending on the input value.

If the value of `self.count` is +1 or -1, then "cat" is returned, otherwise "cats":

```jinja
cat{{ count | pluralize }}
```

You can override the default empty singular suffix, e.g. to spell "doggo" for a single dog:

```jinja
dog{{ count | pluralize("go") }}
```

If the word cannot be declined by simply adding a suffix,
then you can also override singular and the plural, too:

```jinja
{{ count | pluralize("mouse", "mice") }}
```

More complex languages that know multiple plurals might be impossible to implement with this filter,
though.

### ref
[#ref]: #ref

Creates a reference to the given argument.

```jinja
{{ "a" | ref }}
{{ self.x | ref }}
```

will become:

```rust
&"a"
&self.x
```

### safe
[#safe]: #safe

Marks a string (or other Display type) as safe. By default all strings are escaped according to the format.

```
{{ "<p>I'm Safe</p>" | safe }}
```

Output:

```
<p>I'm Safe</p>
```

### title
[#title]: #title

Return a title cased version of the value. Words will start with uppercase letters, all
remaining characters are lowercase.

```jinja
{{ "hello WORLD" | title }}
```

Output:

```text
Hello World
```

### trim
[#trim]: #trim

Strip leading and trailing whitespace.

```jinja
{{ " hello " | trim }}
```

Output:

```text
hello
```

### truncate
[#truncate]: #truncate

Limit string length, appends '...' if truncated.


```jinja
{{ "hello" | truncate(2) }}
```

Output:

```text
he...
```

### upper | uppercase
[#upper]: #upper--uppercase

Converts to uppercase.

```jinja
{{ "hello" | upper }}
```

Output:

```text
HELLO
```

### urlencode | urlencode_strict
[#urlencode]: #urlencode--urlencode_strict

Percent encodes the string. Replaces reserved characters with the % escape character followed by a byte value as two hexadecimal digits.

```jinja
{{ "hello?world" | urlencode }}
```

Output:

```text
hello%3Fworld
```

With `|urlencode` all characters except ASCII letters, digits, and `_.-~/` are escaped.
With `|urlencode_strict` a forward slash `/` is escaped, too.

### wordcount
[#wordcount]: #wordcount

Count the words in that string.

```jinja
{{ "askama is sort of cool" | wordcount }}
```

Output:

```text
5
```

## Optional / feature gated filters
[#optional-filters]: #optional--feature-gated-filters

The following filters can be enabled by requesting the respective feature in the Cargo.toml
[dependencies section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html), e.g.

```toml
[dependencies]
askama = { version = "0.11.2", features = "serde_json" }
```

### `json` | `tojson`
[#json]: #json--tojson

Enabling the `serde_json` feature will enable the use of the `json` filter.
This will output formatted JSON for any value that implements the required
[`Serialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/1.*/serde/trait.Serialize.html) trait.
The generated string does not contain ampersands `&`, chevrons `< >`, or apostrophes `'`.

To use it in a `<script>` you can combine it with the safe filter.
In HTML attributes, you can either use it in quotation marks `"{{data | json}}"` as is,
or in apostrophes with the (optional) safe filter `'{{data | json | safe}}'`.
In HTML texts the output of e.g. `<pre>{{data | json | safe}}</pre>` is safe, too.

```jinja
Good: <li data-extra="{{data | json}}">…</li>
Good: <li data-extra='{{data | json | safe}}'>…</li>
Good: <pre>{{data | json | safe}}</pre>
Good: <script>var data = {{data | json | safe}};</script>

Bad:  <li data-extra="{{data | json | safe}}">…</li>
Bad:  <script>var data = {{data | json}};</script>
Bad:  <script>var data = "{{data | json | safe}}";</script>

Ugly: <script>var data = "{{data | json}}";</script>
Ugly: <script>var data = '{{data | json | safe}}';</script>
```

By default, a compact representation of the data is generated, i.e. no whitespaces are generated
between individual values. To generate a readable representation, you can either pass an integer
how many spaces to use as indentation, or you can pass a string that gets used as prefix:

```jinja2
Prefix with four spaces:
<textarea>{{data | tojson(4)}}</textarea>

Prefix with two &nbsp; characters:
<p>{{data | tojson("\u{a0}\u{a0}")}}</p>
```

## Custom Filters
[#custom-filters]: #custom-filters

To define your own filters, simply have a module named `filters` in scope of the context deriving a `Template` impl 
and define the filters as functions within this module. 
The functions must have at least one argument and the return type must be `askama::Result<T>`.
Although there are no restrictions on `T` for a single filter, 
the final result of a chain of filters must implement `Display`. 

The arguments to the filters are passed as follows. 
The first argument corresponds to the expression they are applied to. 
Subsequent arguments, if any, must be given directly when calling the filter. 
The first argument may or may not be a reference, depending on the context in which the filter is called. 
To abstract over ownership, consider defining your argument as a trait bound.
For example, the `trim` built-in filter accepts any value implementing `Display`. 
Its signature is similar to `fn trim(s: impl std::fmt::Display) -> askama::Result<String>`.

Note that built-in filters have preference over custom filters, so, in case of name collision, the built-in filter is applied.

### Examples

Implementing a filter that replaces all instances of `"oo"` for `"aa"`.
```rust
use askama::Template;

#[derive(Template)]
#[template(source = "{{ s | myfilter }}", ext = "txt")]
struct MyFilterTemplate<'a> {
    s: &'a str,
}

// Any filter defined in the module `filters` is accessible in your template.
mod filters {
    // This filter does not have extra arguments
    pub fn myfilter<T: std::fmt::Display>(s: T) -> askama::Result<String> {
        let s = s.to_string();
        Ok(s.replace("oo", "aa"))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let t = MyFilterTemplate { s: "foo" };
    assert_eq!(t.render().unwrap(), "faa");
}
```

Implementing a filter that replaces all instances of `"oo"` for `n` times `"a"`.
```rust
use askama::Template;

#[derive(Template)]
#[template(source = "{{ s | myfilter(4) }}", ext = "txt")]
struct MyFilterTemplate<'a> {
    s: &'a str,
}

// Any filter defined in the module `filters` is accessible in your template.
mod filters {
    // This filter requires a `usize` input when called in templates
    pub fn myfilter<T: std::fmt::Display>(s: T, n: usize) -> askama::Result<String> {
        let s = s.to_string();
        let mut replace = String::with_capacity(n);
        replace.extend((0..n).map(|_| "a"));
        Ok(s.replace("oo", &replace))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let t = MyFilterTemplate { s: "foo" };
    assert_eq!(t.render().unwrap(), "faaaa");
}
```

## HTML-safe types
[#html-safe-types]: #html-safe-types

Askama will try to avoid escaping types that generate string representations that do not contain
"HTML-unsafe characters".
HTML-safe characters are characters that can be used in any context in HTML texts and attributes.
The "unsafe" characters are: `<`, `>`, `&`, `"` and `'`.

In order to know which types do not need to be escaped, askama has the marker trait
`askama::filters::HtmlSafe`, and any type that implements that trait won't get automatically
escaped in a `{{expr}}` expression.
By default e.g. all primitive integer types are marked as HTML-safe.

You can also mark your custom type `MyStruct` as HTML-safe using:

```rust
impl askama::filters::HtmlSafe for MyStruct {}
```

This automatically marks references `&MyStruct` as HTML-safe, too.

### Safe output of custom filters
[#safe-output-of-custom-filters]: #safe-output-of-custom-filters

Say, you have a custom filter `| strip` that removes all HTML-unsafe characters:

```rust
fn strip(s: impl ToString) -> Result<String, askama::Error> {
    Ok(s.to_string()
        .chars()
        .filter(|c| !matches!(c, '<' | '>' | '&' | '"' | '\''))
        .collect()
    )
}
```

Then you can also mark the output as safe using `askama::filters::Safe`:

```rust
fn strip(s: impl ToString) -> Result<Safe<String>, askama::Error> {
    Ok(Safe(...))
}
```

There also is `askama::filters::MaybeSafe` that can be used to mark *some* output as safe,
if you know that *some* inputs for our filter will always result in a safe output:

```rust
fn as_sign(i: i32) -> Result<MaybeSafe<&'static str>, askama::Error> {
    match i.into() {
        i if i < 0 => Ok(MaybeSafe::NeedsEscaping("<0")),
        i if i > 0 => Ok(MaybeSafe::NeedsEscaping(">0")),
        _          => Ok(MaybeSafe::Safe("=0")),
    }
}
```
